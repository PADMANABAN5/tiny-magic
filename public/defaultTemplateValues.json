  "CONCEPT_NAME": "Performance Undersupply (PUX)",
  "CONCEPT_CONTENT": "PUX Concept",
  "CONCEPT_ENDURING_UNDERSTANDINGS": "- Performance Undersupply is the gap between what's currently delivered and what people could expect once they see what's possible\n- PUX emerges outside the problem space, not from fixing what's broken\n- PUX creates a shift in expectations that users didn't know they could have\n- Traditional problems fix known pain; PUX reframes what's possible",
  "CONCEPT_ESSENTIAL_QUESTIONS": "- How does Performance Undersupply differ from traditional problem-solving?\n- How can we identify Performance Undersupply opportunities when users don't know to ask for them?\n- What triggers a shift in unimagined expectations?\n- How does the introduction of radical possibilities change user perception?\n- Why do users accept certain pains as inevitable until shown alternatives?",
  "CONCEPT_KNOWLEDGE_SKILLS": "- Define Performance Undersupply in their own words\n- Distinguish between PUX and traditional problem-solving\n- Identify the two triggers of Performance Undersupply (Radical Solution Possibility-led and Pain-Is-Inevitable)\n- Analyze examples to determine if they represent Performance Undersupply\n- Generate original examples of Performance Undersupply\n- Apply the Performance Undersupply Loop to identify opportunities\n- Reframe normalized pain into possibility",
  "STAGE_1_CONTENT": "Introduce the foundational definition of Performance Undersupply:\n- The hidden shortfall between what's currently delivered and what people could expect once they see what's possible\n- Normalized pain vs. unimagined expectations\n- The shift from problem-solving to expectation design\nUse simple examples to establish the basic concept, checking for initial comprehension.",
  "STAGE_2_CONTENT": "Explore the anatomy of Performance Undersupply:\n- The core shift in thinking (problem = unmet expectation)\n- The two triggers: Radical Solution Possibility-led Path and Pain-Is-Inevitable Path\n- The Performance Undersupply Loop\nHave the learner deconstruct examples to identify these components.",
  "STAGE_3_CONTENT": "Compare Performance Undersupply with related concepts:\n- PUX vs. Traditional Problem-Solving\n- PUX vs. Incremental Improvement\n- PUX vs. Delight/Satisfaction\nUse contrasting examples to highlight these differences, and challenge the learner to explain why certain cases do or don't qualify as PUX.",
  "STAGE_4_CONTENT": "Guide application of the concept:\n- Have the learner generate their own examples\n- Present scenarios for analysis\n- Explore how to identify PUX opportunities in their context\n- Practice reframing normalized pain points\nChallenge them to transfer the concept to domains not previously discussed.",
  "STAGE_5_CONTENT": "Facilitate reflection and synthesis:\n- Have the learner articulate their evolved understanding\n- Connect PUX to broader innovation principles\n- Discuss challenges in identifying and addressing PUX\n- Explore how this concept changes their perspective\nGuide them to construct a personal framework for applying PUX thinking",
  "CONCEPT_UNDERSTANDING_RUBRIC": "5 - Masterful Reframer\n- Clearly articulates the essence of Performance Undersupply in their own words (not just examples).\n- Consistently distinguishes between PUX and traditional problem-solving.\n- Offers original, creative examples that reflect deep insight.\n- Reframes normalized pain or quiet resignation into possibility.\n- Anticipates how expectations shift as a result of innovation.\n\n4 - Strategic Spotter\n- Strong grasp of the concept with minor gaps.\n- Gives relevant examples and explains them well.\n- Sometimes needs prompting to clearly differentiate PUX from problem-solving.\n- Begins to show reframing mindset but may not do so consistently.\n\n3 - Emerging Thinker\n- Understands basic definition and can spot examples with support.\n- May confuse delight with innovation or mix up problem-solving with PUX.\n- Relies heavily on known examples or surface-level traits.\n- Needs coaching to deepen their framing or spot expectations shifts.\n\n2 - Functional Fixer\n- Focuses mostly on visible problems and fixes.\n- Gives examples that resolve pain but don't reframe norms.\n- Struggles to grasp the mindset of possibility or expectation design.\n- May confuse efficiency gains with PUX.\n\n1 - Unaware or Misguided\n- Shows little or no evidence of understanding PUX.\n- Cannot distinguish it from traditional problem-solving.\n- Provides irrelevant or unclear examples.\n- Needs foundational re-teaching of the core concept.",
  "UNDERSTANDING_SKILLS_RUBRIC": "5 - Self-Aware Sensemaker\n- Asks thoughtful questions to clarify or go deeper.\n- Pauses to reflect before answering.\n- Revises thinking based on feedback.\n- Makes connections across contexts or analogies.\n- Seeks to truly \"make sense,\" not just \"be right.\"\n\n4 - Curious Connector\n- Engages actively and shows curiosity.\n- Offers reasoned explanations for answers.\n- Makes connections between examples and concepts.\n- Occasionally rethinks or refines their view when nudged.\n\n3 - Responsive Reasoner\n- Responds well to prompts or guidance.\n- Shows effort in making sense but needs scaffolding.\n- Sometimes gives surface-level responses without probing deeper.\n- May hesitate to revise initial thinking.\n\n2 - Passive Participant\n- Waits for validation or direction before engaging.\n- Struggles to explain the \"why\" behind their answers.\n- Rarely reflects or self-corrects.\n- Learning is transactional, not exploratory.\n\n1 - Answer-First Thinker\n- Focused on giving quick answers without understanding.\n- Avoids reflection or clarification.\n- Shows minimal engagement in the learning process.\n- Unable or unwilling to explore unfamiliar thinking paths."
