  "CONCEPT_CONTENT": "The full concept document provided, containing all the information about the concept For PUX it will be üåå Performance Undersupply: Designing for Unimagined Expectations\\n\\nüîç What Is Performance Undersupply?\\nPerformance Undersupply is the hidden shortfall between what a product, service, or system currently delivers ‚Äî and what people could come to expect once they see what's truly possible.\\nIt does not emerge from the problem space. It's not about fixing what's broken. It's about recognizing that:\\n‚Ä¢ People often accept painful or mediocre experiences as inevitable\\n‚Ä¢ A radical solution possibility reframes what's possible\\n‚Ä¢ This unlocks new, unimagined expectations that couldn't have been articulated before\\nOnce users experience this new possibility, their perception of \"acceptable\" shifts ‚Äî and the old baseline becomes clearly insufficient, even though it was never previously seen as a problem.\\n\\nüß† The Core Shift in Thinking\\nThe traditional framing:\\nProblem = Something broken that needs fixing\\nOur updated lens:\\nProblem = An unmet expectation\\nPerformance Undersupply ‚â† Unmet expectation ‚Äî it arises from expectations that users didn't even know they could have\\nThis is a foundational shift. You cannot detect performance undersupply by looking only at complaints, friction, or dissatisfaction. You need to explore radical solution possibilities that provoke a rethink of the entire value frame.\\n\\nüîÅ Expert Lens Redefined\\nTraditional Lens Updated Expert Lens\\nProblem = friction or failure Problem = unmet expectation\\nProblem-solving reveals performance gaps Performance undersupply emerges outside the problem space\\nFocus on reducing pain Focus on creating a shift in what's expected or imagined\\n\\nüõ§Ô∏è Two Triggers of Performance Undersupply\\nPerformance undersupply can be triggered in two distinct ways:\\n\\nüü• 1. Radical Solution Possibility-led Path\\nThis is when a bold, transformative idea ‚Äî whether technological, behavioral, or design-led ‚Äî introduces a performance level that users never imagined was possible.\\n\"Before the iPhone, we didn't know we needed an all-in-one digital life device.\"\\n\"Once I used Uber, waiting for cabs suddenly felt absurd.\"\\nThe radical solution reveals new expectations ‚Äî and users never see the old way the same again.\\n\\nüü¶ 2. Pain-Is-Inevitable Path\\nIn this path, a silent, normalized pain is accepted as a fact of life. It's not a \"problem\" in the traditional sense because users believe it's unavoidable. But once a new lens is applied ‚Äî a reframing, a technology shift, or a different approach ‚Äî this pain is exposed as unnecessary.\\n\"I thought buffering was just part of streaming ‚Äî until Netflix made it vanish.\"\\n\"Filling out forms always seemed necessary ‚Äî until ClearCover auto-filled everything for me.\"\\nThe performance undersupply here was always present, but invisible ‚Äî until reimagined through a new possibility.\\n\\nüö´ Performance Undersupply ‚â† Problem-Solving\\nProblem-Solving Performance Undersupply\\nBegins with a known pain or unmet expectation Begins with a radical possibility or normalized pain\\nAims to fix what's broken Aims to redefine what users believe is possible\\nSolves for dissatisfaction Creates surprise, delight, or demand where none existed\\nUser says: \"This isn't working\" User says: \"I didn't know I could have this ‚Äî now I want it everywhere\"\\nGoal = reduce friction Goal = shift expectation and unlock unseen potential\\n\\nüå± Expectations, Problems & Performance Undersupply\\nConcept Description Role\\nProblem A misalignment between expected and actual experience Grounded in current expectations\\nInevitable Pain Discomfort accepted as part of the system Often goes unquestioned ‚Äî until reframed\\nExpectation What users believe \"should\" happen Anchors their current satisfaction or complaint\\nUnimagined Expectation A desire or standard that only arises once users see a new possibility Triggers the feeling of undersupply\\nPerformance Undersupply The gap that only becomes visible after a possibility is revealed Drives product and service transformation\\n\\nüîÅ The Performance Undersupply Loop\\n1. Status Quo: Users tolerate a current experience ‚Äî not perfect, but \"fine\"\\n2. Radical Possibility Introduced: A new solution shows what could be\\n3. Unimagined Expectations Sparked: Users realize what they were missing\\n4. Perception Shift: The old experience now feels clearly insufficient\\n5. Market Pull: Demand emerges where none existed ‚Äî not from fixing, but from reimagining\\n\\nüß™ Real-World Examples\\nDomain \"Inevitable\" Pain Radical Possibility New Expectation\\nPhones Typing on physical keypads, managing multiple devices iPhone combines communication, browsing, apps One device to run your life\\nTransportation Waiting for cabs, unreliable fares Uber + live map + one-tap booking Instant, trackable rides\\nContent Scheduled TV, DVDs, downloads Netflix + streaming + no buffering Watch anything, anywhere, instantly\\nWork Endless tabs, notifications, tools Notion centralizes context + docs Work that thinks with you\\nInsurance Filling out forms, long calls ClearCover autofills based on context Fast, paperless coverage in minutes\\n\\nüß≠ Why This Matters\\nIn a world flooded with problem-solvers and optimizers, true innovation comes from performance reframers ‚Äî people who:\\n‚Ä¢ Imagine new possibilities\\n‚Ä¢ Trigger unimagined expectations\\n‚Ä¢ Shift what users believe is even worth asking for\\nThis is the essence of Performance Undersupply. It's not about serving known demand. It's about creating new demand ‚Äî by helping people see and expect more than they ever knew was missing.",
